#1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset? It is a large-scale dataset commonly used to train and evaluate image classification models, offering a more realistic and challenging alternative to the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

#2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training? We normalize image pixel values before training to keep all inputs on a similar scale, which helps the model learn faster, train more stably, and converge better. It will also prevents large pixel values from dominating the learning process and improves overall performance.

#3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.

#4. What does an epoch mean in model training?

#5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.

#6. What could be done to improve the model's accuracy?
